Step 1 - Create Two IAM roles as:
            1. In first provide AmazonEC2RoleforAWSCodeDeploy and AmazonS3FullAccess
            2. In second provide codedeplyrole role.        => ASG
            This roles will be used further.

Step 2 - Create 4 ec2 instances and put user data in it
            #!/bin/bash
            sudo yum -y update
            sudo yum -y install ruby
            sudo yum -y install wget
            cd /home/ec2-user
            wget https://aws-codedeploy-ap-south-1.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/l
            atest/install
            sudo chmod +x ./install
            sudo ./install auto
            sudo yum install -y python-pip
            sudo pip install awscli

            This user data includes installation of some software like awscodedeploy , awscli etc.
            Then:
            - Add first IAM role to the instances .
            - Create Security Group and provide http 80 and ssh 22 rules.
            - Then create instances.

Step 3 - Create an AMI of any of the instance which we will use in AutoScalingGroup.

Step 4 - Create Application Load Balancer.
        1. Create target group than load balancer , in target group give path to /index.html , which is the app file containing code over git.

        2. Now Create Application Load Balancer

Step 5 - Create 'Launch Configurations' or 'Launch template' and than create Auto scaling group.
        Launch Configuration created Now create AutoScalingGroup
        Attach Application Load Balancer to it which is already created
        Give Desired and max capacity to 2
        Auto Scaling Group is created.
        We can see as soon as ASG created , the two instances are up.

Step 6 - Create one Jenkins Instance and install jenkins software in it.

Step 7 - Create CodeDeploy
         Create Application
         Now Create Deployment Group
            Enter ARN of the '2nd role'
         Now Choose Amazon Ec2 ASG which we have Created earlier
         Now choose Application Load balancer which we have created earlier
         Deployment Group Is Created.
         Now we will use Jenkins for Creating a pipeline that will use git as a source and will run the CodeDeploy

Step 8 - Create an S3 bucket
Step 9 - Go to Jenkins Server
        - Install 'AWS CodeDeploy' and' AWS CodePipeline' plugin in it
        https://github.com/vaibhavjain2099/aws_codedeploy_using_github.git
        Create a jenkins pipeline by taking GIT as a source , Trigger - Poll SCM ( * * * * * ) which means it will run job in every minute.
        
        Fill in the neccessary details like:
            - Application name
            - Application group
            - Application deployment config
            - Put S3 Bucket name etc.

            Therer is just so much to consider here. But we are finally here, THANK GOD!!
